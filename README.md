### Hello there (PROJECT PAUSED)

This is a side project of mine to practice ReactJS hooks and making an efficiently performing and smooth Netlfix-clone like application.
The project is at a halt right now, as I am working on other adventures to improve my skills. Nonetheless, all the major features of the applications have been implemented, with only minor additions planned for the future. However, my attention will now turn towards creating map applications with the use of Leaflet, and mastering server-side rendering with Next.js and Gatsby.
